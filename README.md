# UCSD-Unfolding_Maps
This is a project that I made during my online course. In this project I used applet window that shows a map.This projects takes in live feed data and represents it on a map(online). Clicking on the rectangle( Click to Display Top 5 Earthquakes) shows the info of top 5 Earthquakes with there Markers only on map. The text on rectangle changes to - Click to Display All - and clicking it brings all the markers back.  When we click on the Earthquake marker, the along with previous functions, it shows the threat  circle for that earthquake, as the image shows. This threat circle disappears when we deselect the Marker or we are outside the Marker. Map shows cross(x) on earthquakes which happened past hour or past day (Both are of different colors).Their info is also provided in the key  The Map has colored countries that represent the No. of earthquakes in that country. The more closer to black color - the more no. of earthquakes - and closer to  White - less earthquakes.White color means zero earthquakes.
